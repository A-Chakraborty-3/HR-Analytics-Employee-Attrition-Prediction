# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Prediction
This project analyzes employee attrition data using Python and Power BI to identify patterns and predict employee churn. It combines machine learning, exploratory data analysis, and interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights to HR teams.

**🚀 Project Goals**

  *Predict employee attrition using machine learning

  *Understand key drivers behind attrition (e.g., income, job satisfaction)

  *Deliver business insights with visualizations and dashboards

  *Support HR in improving retention strategies

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

  *Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

  *Jupyter Notebook

  *CSV Dataset

**📁 Dataset**

  The dataset contains 35+ features such as:

  Age, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, YearsAtCompany

  OverTime, BusinessTravel, EnvironmentSatisfaction

  Target column: Attrition (Yes / No)

**📌 Key Insights**

  *Employees with lower monthly income are more likely to leave

  * Sales and HR show higher attrition compared to R&D

  * Overtime workers and low job satisfaction scores correlate with higher attrition

  * Younger employees (<30) with less tenure are more likely to leave
